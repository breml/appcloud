# Example App in Go(lang) for Cloud Foundry App Cloud

Inspired by the [this blog post](https://ict.swisscom.ch/2015/11/push-your-first-node-js-app-into-the-cloud/) about the deployment of a node.js example app to the [Swisscom Application Cloud](http://developer.swisscom.com/), I decided to test the Swisscom Application Cloud my self with a similar app, written in Google Go language.

You may find more details in my [blog post](https://breml.github.io/blog/2015/12/17/deploy-a-go-web-app-to-the-swisscom-application-cloud/).
