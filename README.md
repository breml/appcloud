# Example App in Go(lang) for Cloud Foundry App Cloud

Inspired by the node.js [example](https://ict.swisscom.ch/2015/11/push-your-first-node-js-app-into-the-cloud/) [app](https://ict.swisscom.ch/2015/12/move-with-your-mongodb-node-js-into-the-cloud/) in the [Swisscom blog](https://ict.swisscom.ch/category/developer/), I decided to test the Swisscom Application Cloud with a similar app, written with the Google [Go](https://golang.org) language.
